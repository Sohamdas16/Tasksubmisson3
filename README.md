Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
Problem Statement

Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument.

Calculates the factorial of the given number using a loop.

Returns the calculated factorial value.

Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

Key Features
Function Usage

The program uses a user-defined function to calculate the factorial.

The function improves code reusability and readability.

Factorial Logic

The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

Mathematical representation:

n! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n


Example:

5! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120
THE OUTPUT:
Enter a number5
Factorial of 5 is: 120


Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
Problem Statement

Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

Asks the user to enter a number.

Uses the math module to calculate:

Square root of the number

Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number

Sine of the number (in radians)

Displays the calculated results on the screen.

Key Features
User Input

The program accepts a number from the user.

The input is converted into a floating-point value to support decimal numbers.

Use of Math Module

The built-in math module is used to perform advanced mathematical calculations:

math.sqrt() → Calculates square root

math.log() → Calculates natural logarithm

math.sin() → Calculates sine value (in radians)

THE OUTPUT:
Enter a number5
The square root is 2.23606797749979
The log of the number is 1.6094379124341003
Sine : 0.08715574274765817
