Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
Problem Statement

Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument.

Calculates the factorial of the given number using a loop.

Returns the calculated factorial value.

Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

Key Features
Function Usage

The program uses a user-defined function to calculate the factorial.

The function improves code reusability and readability.

Factorial Logic

The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

Mathematical representation:

n! = 1 × 2 × 3 × ... × n


Example:

5! = 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 = 120
